# JavaScript Capstone Project: Build a Platform Game
This is Microverse's final project in Javascript's course.

In this project, I build a Platform game using JavaScript's framework, a "fast, free and fun open-source framework for Canvas and WebGL powered browser games".

## About

This project's objective was to build a Platform game.

The assignment can be seen [here][assignment].

Link to a live version [here][live-version].

Repository: https://github.com/arslanbisharat/PLATFORM_GAME

## The game
First you can Add your name to the game.

This is a simple endless runner. Enemies appear walking towards you, some pursue you. You have to over-pass them. Just cross  as many enemies as you can before you you die. 

### How to play

First the most important: how to play.

The commands were explained in the previous section **![wasd][wasd]** to move ![space][space] to shoot.


You can play the game online clicking [here][live-version] or locally following these steps:

* Click on the green button "Clone or Download"
* Click on Download ZIP
* Extract the game
* In your terminal, navigate to the game's folder
* Run 'node server.js'
* Open, in your browser, 'localhost:8080'

### Design

First of all: this is a simple pixel game. You can't expect to see high-quality graphics. Or medium-quality graphics... So, the ship's designs are just a low-quality version of the orignal design.
#### Scenes

This game is composed by six scenes each one with its music:
## Technologies used
